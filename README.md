# AFK-GUYS
Doesn't work at the moment, freezes game and crashes PC.

Github is manely used for Help right now, any help will be appreciated.

Info:
To use: start Fallguys in 1920x1080
type 1 in the console and switch back to the fallguys lobby
now it should work but I have a few coding mistakes so it will freeze. :(
